Project Submission Procedure
============================

## Summary

1. **Code Submission:** Code passing all unit tests for a given release is committed to github and student [creates a new release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/).
2. **Preliminary code review:** *If and only if* code is passing all tests, the professor or TA reviews code to verify student is ready for in-person code review.
3. **In-person code review:** Student meets with instructor for 15-minute code review session. Instructor outlines all design changes required before next submission.
4. **Revision:** Student applies all required design changes.
5. **Resubmmision:** Student commits revised code to github and [creates a new release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/).
6. **Repeat:** *At most once per week* steps 1-5 will be repeated until the final deadline. In some cases a student may be exempted from step 3 for a second or subsequent resubmission.

## Overview

The goal of the code review process is to allow you to improve your code design skills and it is *expected* that you will need to revise and resubmit your solution, possibly multiple times. This is a learning process!

## Grading

The project will be completed in three releases. Each release must **demonstrate mastery** before the next release may be attempted. 

To demonstrate mastery, a solution must meet the following criteria:

1. **Functionality** - The solution must pass all test cases.
2. **Code quality** - The solution must meet the code quality requirements defined during the code review process.

To pass this course, a student must demonstrate mastery on releases 1 and 2, and must meet all functionality requirements of release 3. 

Once mastery is demonstrated, full credit is awarded. Partial credit will only be awarded on release 3, and release 3 may only be attempted after mastery is demonstrated on releases 1 and 2.

### Deductions

The following deductions may be applied to any solution. Note, this means that the final grade may be lower than the 100% awarded for demonstration of mastery! Make absolutely certain that you have carefully reviewed a revision before submitting it for the next code review.

**Failing test cases** - If a resubmitted solution does not pass all test cases a 5-point deduction will be applied. 

**Failure to address all open issues** - If a resubmitted solution fails to address any in-line comments or open issues a 5-point deduction will be applied. 

**Failure to schedule in-person code review** - Failure to schedule a code review in a timely manner may result in a **0** on the assignment.

**Failure to explain or reproduce code** - At any time, a student may be required to meet with the instructor for an in-person code walkthrough. This is different from a standard code review. During the code walkthrough the instructor will ask the student to explain his/her code or to reproduce part of the solution. Failure to adequately explain or reproduce code will result in a **0** on the assignment.

## Code Review

If your solution meets the functionality requirements it will be verified by an instructor or TA. Once the solution has been verified you will be sent a google calendar link to sign up for a 15-minute **in-person code review appointment**. During the code review, the reviewer will look for poor design elements and will note all design elements that must be improved for the next revision. Examples of poor design elements include long and confusing methods that should be decomposed into multiple smaller methods, and inefficient algorithms that result in slow execution.

Required revisions will be noted either as inline comments or as [open issues](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues/). 

:warning: Make sure to fetch changes after code review and before you begin revisions. If you do not you are likely to end up with nasty [merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/).

### Revise/Resubmit/Repeat

It will normally take approximately one week for the instructor or TA to complete a code verification. *Please do not expect immediate feedback!* Once the in-person code review is complete, you will need to address all open issues and comments before resubmission.

:warning: Assignments may be resubmitted **at most** once per week. Make sure you plan for this as you consider the final deadline.

As noted above, deductions **will** be taken if a resubmitted solution does not pass all test cases or does not address all open issues and inline comments. You need to be *certain* your solution is worthy of a resubmission before you create a new release. You may always visit office hours with questions, but please do not ask the instructor or TA to pre-grade your assignment to tell you if it is ready for resubmission.

### Final Deadline

Release 3 must complete code review during or before finals week. This means that release 2 must demonstrate mastery the final week of classes. Make sure to plan carefully, as failure to make sufficient progress will result in an F in the class!
